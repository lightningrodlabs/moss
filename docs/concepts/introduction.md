# Introduction to The Weave

What we now call "The Web" was the result of three critical new open standards: HTML, HTTP and the URL. These allowed anybody to publish documents and link to them from other documents. The advent of Javascript and CSS made it so these documents were both beautiful and as functional as any computer program.

But none of those open standards enabled creation and management of **social spaces** by groups. So, that critical function has become siloed into the big corporate websites: Facebook holds group's "Page", GitHub holds your code, GSuite holds your collaboration tools.

[Holochain](https://holochain.org) is an open standard that delivers creating small functioning **social space** units, in a way that is both scalable, and decentralized. To that we now add the **Weave Interaction Pattern**, an open standard for creating, searching, linking and organizing these **social space** units into complex social fabric that yields "The Weave".
