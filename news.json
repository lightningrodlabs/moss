We think this will be a fun way for us to get to play with the Weave that will spark creative connection. \n\n Join the [open Weavers group](https://lightningrodlabs.org/we?we://group/d86f59b5-def4-4fbb-961e-be487d87df74) ahead of time so your node has time to syncronize. \n\n The event will be live on Zoom at [this link](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/82751356671?pwd=hC3DTPti3aB0IIMuVLDnQlLB4LZNu8.1)"
