## AssetServices.userSelectAsset property

Prompts the user to select an Asset and returns the associated WAL as soon as the user has selected an asset or returns undefined if the user cancels the selection process. By default it will let the user select the Asset from the pocket but other means of selecting the asset can be specified optionally with the "from" argument.

**Signature:**

```typescript
userSelectAsset: (from?: 'search' | 'pocket' | 'create') => Promise<WAL | undefined>;
```
