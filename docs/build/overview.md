# Choose Your Path

## Option 1: Start from Scratch

Building a Tool for the Weave typically happens in **three steps**:

1. üßÅ Build a normal [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) app
2. üßÇ Add some sugar to make it run in Moss
3. üß∂ _(optional)_ Knit it together with other Tools by leveraging the interoperability of the Weave Interacion Protocol (WIP)

## Option 2: Fork and Extend

Instead of building an app from scratch, you can clone an existing Tool and extend from it.

Here are links to a few existing Weave Tools that you may use as a starting point or inspiration, sorted by UI framework:

### **Svelte**

- [KanDo](https://github.com/holochain-apps/kando): Real-time Kanban boards
- [Converge](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/converge): Decision-making tool

### Lit

- [Notebooks](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks): Real-time note taking
- [Presence](https://github.com/matthme/presence): Video Calling
